Running tests
=============

Running tests for the current project is possible to do in classic way to utilize `pytest` execution parameters.

Also you can use *Allure* to generate test reports along  *pytest reports* with the appropriate environment.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pytest --env=staging --alluredir=./allure-results

More details check in the `test <../README_.html#tests>`_ section.
