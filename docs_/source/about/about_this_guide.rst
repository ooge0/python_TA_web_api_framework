The Story
===============================================================================

This guide as part of my own developed solution as structured projects where I focused on :term:`Pytest`, :term:`Allure_Pytest`, :term:`Tox`, :term:`PlantUML`, :term:`Sphinx` as the main tools for creating, proposing, analysing, documenting, maintaining test automation frameworks.
Here I combined discovered approaches for building test automation frameworks, my personal coding skills, suggestions from different resources, blogs, youTube channels, other internet resources.

All references you can find in this guide or on the :ref:`glossary_page` page


Scope
===============================================================================
The scope of the guide are:
* describing and explaining structure of test framework, see :ref:`framework_structure_page`,
* created test automation framework,
* framework features:
* utilized Sphinx options,
* reStructured format features for making documents
* usage of PlantUML Standard Library (:term:`PlantUMLStdlib`) for building graphs and trees to visualize implemented solutions in my test automation frameworks.


This guide does NOT provide detailed instructions on how to create a test automation framework, but it can help people how is new in test automation to learn the features developed and reuse them on their own.


Goals
===============================================================================

#. Create a user-focused guide for created tests automation framework.
#. Create a guide that was better than I found on the different platforms, sites forums, GITs.
#. Grow my personal technical skills and practise in creation not only test documentation but and project documentation using automated tools, like Sphinx, PlantUML and Python scripting.

Principles
===============================================================================

The Principles on which this guide are based:

#. Develop a solution that is clear, practical, and easy to understand.
#. Deepen knowledge through investigation and exploration of diverse resources.
#. Share reusable code examples to encourage best practices and efficiency.
#. Embrace the idea that teaching is learning twiceâ€”enhance understanding by sharing insights.
#. Build an open-source project accessible to anyone, encouraging contributions to enrich this guide.
#. Apply the "Documentation-As-Code" approach to ensure code and documentation evolve together.
#. Maintain a living document that grows and adapts with the project.
